# Quiz-Program

This is my project for the Programming Fundamentals course in my first semester at Superior University. 
It consists of a title art, a question that asks for user preferance about the quiz they are interested in and then generates the quiz related to the option the user selected. There are a total of ten questions for each quiz. At the end, the user is scored based on their answers.
